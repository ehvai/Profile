            Ever since the internet has been a thing, web pages have become more
            than just a list of links or words. They have expanded to be a
            visual representation of an idea. Developing a webpage is a way to
            showcase our creativity while allowing the logical side to get to
            work.

            Working alone on a project is great. It feels good to get it done
            and know that you put in all the work for it. What is even better,
            though, is working with a group of people and having that sense of
            accomplishment when it is done that you can share with your
            teammates.

            I am a gamer at heart. I get to spend time with friends online
            exploring new worlds. My love of gaming is not exlusive to video
            games, I also enjoy playing D&D in all its various incarnations with
            the same group of friends I have known for 20 years. The best part
            about it is creating memories that we talk about years later.

            I also enjoy crafting including painting, drawing and anything that
            lets me work with my hands. Although I don't do it often enough,
            crafting lets me explore other creative outlets. My sister is an
            avid crafter and we go to gaming conventions where we make
            interesting things for very interesting people.
